# Parsing Illustrator
A UI tool written in Scala to illustrate various algorithms in parsing of the Language Theory and Interpretation course of Hanoi University of Science and Technology

For the algorithms in the parsing part of the course often require us to illustrate by hand, which is kind of frustrating, this tool demontrates these algorithms for us.

The program includes:
- Top-down parsing algorithms for given string and grammar.
- Bottom-up parsing algorithms for given string and grammar.
- Finding FIRST and FOLLOW set for each symbol in the grammar.
